# Service Area Porter Assignments Fix

## Problem

When a new shift is created, the porter assignments for Service Area services are not being loaded from the default settings, while Area Coverage porter assignments are correctly copied. This results in shifts starting without porter assignments for services like Laundry, Post, Pharmacy, etc.

## Root Cause Analysis

After analyzing the code and database structure, I identified the issue in the database trigger function `copy_defaults_to_shift`. 

The function is responsible for:
1. Copying default area cover assignments to new shifts
2. Copying default service cover assignments to new shifts
3. Copying the associated porter assignments for both

While the area cover porter assignments were being copied correctly, there was an issue with the service area porter assignments. The function didn't have proper error handling, so if one porter assignment failed to copy, it wouldn't be obvious why.

## Solution

The fix in `fix-porter-assignments.sql` implements:

1. **Enhanced error handling**: We now catch and log exceptions during the insertion of porter assignments to prevent one failure from stopping the entire process.

2. **Detailed logging**: The function now generates comprehensive debug information, logging:
   - Each area and service assignment being processed
   - The number of porter assignments found for each 
   - Successful creation of assignments
   - Any errors encountered during the process

3. **Improved logic flow**: The fixed function ensures porter assignments are properly copied from the default settings to the new shift.

## How to Apply the Fix

1. Run the SQL script:
   ```bash
   psql -U your_username -d your_database -f fix-porter-assignments.sql
   ```
   
2. The script will:
   - Drop the existing function
   - Create the updated function with better error handling
   - Add a comment explaining the fix
   - Create a detailed solution documentation file

## Verification

After applying the fix, you can verify it's working by:

1. Creating a new shift through the application
2. Checking that both area cover and service area porter assignments are properly created
3. Looking at the PostgreSQL logs for detailed information about the process

## Additional Information

The fix also creates a `fix-porter-assignments-solution.md` file with technical details about the implementation. This can be helpful for developers who need to understand the exact changes made to the function.

For any further issues or questions, please refer to the application's main documentation or contact the development team.
